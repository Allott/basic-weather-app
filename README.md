Small tech task

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Todo / Things to improve
- error handling needs more thought IMO
- loading spinner
- could raise query and pass loading ect to search bar for styling reasons
- actual routing would be good
- prettier
- components should be more versatile
- more testcases for components
- some sort of user journey test would be good too
- there is probably a type best practise or two broken somewhere here, need more experience
